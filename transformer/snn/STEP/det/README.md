## Detection

Detection is a crucial component in image processing. In our implementation, we use the widely adopted [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) 
framework to handle detection tasks, while leveraging BrainCog as the backbone framework for building Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs).

The usage of mmdet is very similar to mmseg

Checkpoints can be downloaded from **[official repo on huggingface](https://huggingface.co/Fancysean/STEP)**

### Guidelines
#### Code Environment
1. **The path configuration for your code repository should be as follows.**
```angular2html
.
├── Readme.md
└── cls
    ├── configs
    │   ├── _base_
    │   ├──spikformer
    │   └── ...
    ├── mmdet
    │   ├── apis
    │   ├── datasets
    │   ├── models
    │   ├── engine
    │   └── ...
    ├── requirements
    │   ├── albu.txt
    │   └── ...
    ├── tools
    │   ├── train.py
    │   └── ...
    ├── readme.md
    ├── setup.p
    └── ...
```

2. **Environment**

BrainCog is a **prerequisite for all tasks**. For installation instructions, please refer to [Here](../README.md#braincog-installation).

The mmseg framework has strict environment requirements. We recommend aligning your package versions with the ones listed
below to ensure proper functionality.

It is important to note that due to compatibility issues with mmseg, servers running CUDA 12.x may still encounter errors 
even if all package versions are aligned as recommended. **Therefore, we strongly recommend using a CUDA 11.x environment for optimal stability**.
```angular2html
    python == 3.10.x
    torch == 2.0.1+cu118
    mmcv == 2.0.1
    mmengine == 0.10.7
    mmdet == 3.1.0
    numpy == 1.26.4
```


3. **Usage**
- **model construction**: Create your model and place it under ```mmdet/models/[model_type]/```.
- **model register**: Register your model with ```@MODELS.register_module()``` then import it in the corresponding ```__init__.py```.
- **model config**: Create a config file for your model and place it under ```configs/[model]/```. You can import some pre-defined configs from ```configs/_base_/```.

4. **Training**
Here is an example for training Spikformer 8-512 on 1 GPU:
- `cd tools`
- `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 ./dist_train.sh ../configs/sdt_mask_rcnn/mask-rcnn_sdt-t_fpn_1x_coco.py 8`
